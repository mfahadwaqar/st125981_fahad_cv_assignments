This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks for the three tasks in Assignment 3.

### Task 1: Graph Cut Segmentation

Description: Implements graph-based image segmentation using OpenCV's cv2.grabCut function, initialized with bounding boxes from a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model.

### Task 2: Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)

Description: Implements and trains FCN variants (FCN-32s, 16s, 8s) for semantic segmentation. Compares transpose convolution and bilinear interpolation upsampling methods on both a custom dataset and the PASCAL VOC dataset.

### Task 3: Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

Description: Implements a Convolutional VAE on the MNIST dataset. The notebook trains two models to analyze the effect of latent dimensionality (128 vs. 256) on reconstruction quality, generation, and latent space structure.
